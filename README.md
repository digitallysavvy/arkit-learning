# arkit-learning
A collection of ARKit builds from the Udemy Course: ["The Complete ARKit Course"](https://www.udemy.com/ios-augmented-reality-the-complete-course-on-arkit/learn/v4/overview) with some customizations/add-ons to keep things interesting.


## Projects

1. World Tracking : add AR Scene View to storyboard, initialize world tracking session with debug options (feature point and world origin tracking). add primitive shapes, apply translations and rotations (parent-child)
2. AR Drawing : allow user to paint in AR world space. detect user button press and add 3d spheres to scene during render. _(extended ui to swap brush color)_
3. Planets : AR scene with spheres that have independent rotation animations, using planets as the example.
